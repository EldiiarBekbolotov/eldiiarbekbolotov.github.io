<!--
Hi Everyone.

Thank You for being a great group of students and making this year the very best. This presentation is dedicated to everyone single one of you and Mr. Knight and Mrs. Code who have worked very hard to provide a premier education for me and everyone else in R8D.

First, I would like to thank everybody for their co-operation and being very supportive to me and everyone else. No one has ever put me down in this class and everyone is very easy to work with and I don't remember any major conflicts both in and out of the classroom this year. A lot of people in this class have supported me academically and athletically, whether it is being there for a certain game or just saying Good Job that I made the team... I believe that this class is very positive because everybody has congratulated me when I had academic and athletic achievements this year and nobody was jealous at all. That is certainly a very important thing to have in any classroom or work environment. You guys really helped me out and I hope that I've helped you guys too this year.

Second, I would like to thank everybody for helping create a very productive classroom environment. There are a lot of classrooms in the world where there's too many people and it's too loud and you can't finish anything because of so many distractions everywhere around you. This class is not one of them. This class allows me to finish my schoolwork in class so that I don't have any homework. The classroom is a very important part of school. Thank you R8D for making this classroom a healthy school environment where I can study hard, finish work quickly, and grow academically.

Third, I would like to thank everybody for making this a very enjoyable last year of elementary school. You guys have taught me some very important lessons about hard work, perseverance, and commitment and I've become more mentally strong and resilient because of that. You can be assured that I value every single one of you and I am grateful to be part of this class. I had a lot of fun with everyone in this class and I hope you have enjoyed this year as much as I have enjoyed it myself.

Thank you for being great classmates and I hope you have a fantastic freshman year of high school. My wish is to help as many people in this class during high school as possible. Join me. Don't bully each other. If they look like they're struggling, help them out. Be kind and supportive. 

I'd like to thank everybody once again for your time and being very good listeners.
